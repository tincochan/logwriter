# logWriter

An Electron app using React, MongoDB (mongoose), and Webpack to track and share bugs with team-mates.

Haven never taken a look at the desktop side of things, aside from some light GUI work in Java, I thought
it would fun to try and take a stab at using Electron. Having been used for amazing apps like Slack and VsCode, I imagined it would be a rather involved process, but was very happy to find that using Electron has been a breeze and quite enjoyable.
